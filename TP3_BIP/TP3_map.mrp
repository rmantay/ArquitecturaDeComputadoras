Design Summary
--------------
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    1
Logic Utilization:
  Total Number Slice Registers:         208 out of   1,920   10%
    Number used as Flip Flops:          197
    Number used as Latches:              11
  Number of 4 input LUTs:               449 out of   1,920   23%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:            285 out of     960   29%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:     285 out of     285 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of     285   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:         461 out of   1,920   24%
    Number used as logic:               385
    Number used as a route-thru:         12
    Number used for Dual Port RAMs:      64
      (Two LUTs used per Dual Port RAM)

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                  3 out of      83    3%
  Number of RAMB16s:                      1 out of       4   25%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     1 out of      24    4%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.90

Peak Memory Usage:  236 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  7 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   1 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.

Section 1 - Errors
------------------

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   bip/cpu/control/InstrDecoder/SEL_A_not0001 is sourced by a combinatorial pin.
   This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of
   data into the flip-flop.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network interfaz/fifo_interfaz/Mram_cola_circular16/SPO
   has no load.
INFO:LIT:395 - The above info message is repeated 31 more times for the
   following (max. 5 shown):
   interfaz/fifo_interfaz/Mram_cola_circular15/SPO,
   interfaz/fifo_interfaz/Mram_cola_circular14/SPO,
   interfaz/fifo_interfaz/Mram_cola_circular13/SPO,
   interfaz/fifo_interfaz/Mram_cola_circular12/SPO,
   interfaz/fifo_interfaz/Mram_cola_circular11/SPO
   To see the details of these info messages, please use the -detail switch.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
   2 block(s) optimized away

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

Optimized Block(s):
TYPE 		BLOCK
GND 		XST_GND
VCC 		XST_VCC

To enable printing of redundant blocks removed and signals merged, set the
detailed map report option and rerun map.
